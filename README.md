## tl;dr

Assuming you have already created a virtual environment(venv) and activated it:

```python
django-admin startapp kamehameha --template <update_url_to_zip>
```

(Optional: Upgrade your pip installation)

```python
pip install -r .\requirements\dev.txt
```

```python
python manage.py makemigrations
```

```python
python manage.py migrate
```

```python
python manage.py runserver
```
